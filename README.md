There used to be this minimalist timer app called "Untime" (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnXotUEVL5I), I loved it's style but it is no longer maintained or available. So here I am, recreating a very basic version of it.

When you click on the timer screen, a numerical timer and a reset button will appear.
